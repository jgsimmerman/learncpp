# learncpp
It's a been a while since I've used C++ and it has a lot of new features. I'm using learncpp.com as a refresher of the things I know, and a crash course of the things I don't. I'm also converting the code to TypeScript where it's possible. Not everything will work, but I'm trying to get used to think of JS within the context of types and classes.
